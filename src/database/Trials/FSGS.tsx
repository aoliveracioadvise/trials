      "A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of DMX-200 in Patients With FSGS Who Are Receiving an ARB",
    "Study URL": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05183646",
    Acronym: "ACTION3",
    "Study Status": "RECRUITING",
    "Brief Summary":
      "DMX-200 (repagermanium) is a C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitor that, when administered concurrently with an ARB, is designed to inhibit recruitment of monocytes implicated in the inflammatory chemokine environment of chronic disease. The purpose of this pivotal randomized double-blind study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of DMX-200 120 mg twice daily (BID) compared with placebo over a treatment period of 104 weeks in adult patients with FSGS who are being treated with an ARB. Given the rarity of the disease and the similarities between adults and pediatric patients with FSGS, Dimerix will also investigate the efficacy and safety of DMX 200 in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The double-blind period will be followed by an open-label extension (OLE) which aims to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of DMX 200 for up to 2 additional years.",
